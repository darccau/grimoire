XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability is a type of attack that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on a web application. It occurs when an application processes XML input that contains a reference to an external entity, which can be used to access local or external resources. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read or modify sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or launch denial of service attacks.
